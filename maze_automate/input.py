    Arguments:
    filename = a semicolon delimited file with the following information
    first column = any info that should stay associated with the sentence such as condition etc
    this will be copied to eventual output unchanged (but will be the condition info if ibex output format is used
    second column = item number.
    Third column = sentence
    Fourth column = labels; if it exists, must be same number of wo./d  rds as sentence. if it doesn't exist,
    will be given 1:n labels ()
